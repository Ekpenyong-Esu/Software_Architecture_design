* **Response Format:** Explain the format of the response data returned by the API (e.g., JSON, XML).

**Structure your API reference logically, grouping related functionalities together.** 

**Here are some additional considerations:**

* Use code blocks to present API calls and responses in a structured way.
* Include error codes and their corresponding meanings.
* Provide links to example code snippets or tutorials demonstrating API usage (optional).
